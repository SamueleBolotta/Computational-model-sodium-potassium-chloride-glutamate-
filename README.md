# Computational-model-sodium-potassium-chloride-glutamate-
This is a computational model that extends HH with synaptic inputs

You need to run the main script only.

- "Alpham", "Alphan", "Alphah", "Betam", "Betan" and "Betah" should not be modified.
- "Smoothstep" takes care of the potassium and sodium currents.
- "gSyn" takes care of the synaptic currents.
- "myOde" takes care of the differential equations.
